# ShadowKVM automatically switches your monitor’s input source when you attach or detach
# a keyboard or mouse. For example, when you connect a keyboard to your computer, ShadowKVM
# can switch your monitor to HDMI1, and when you disconnect the keyboard, it can switch 
# the monitor to HDMI2.

# Trigger device: Defines which device type will trigger monitor switching
# options: keyboard or mouse (or one of the GUID_DEVINTERFACE_* guids)
trigger-device: keyboard

# Monitor actions: When a trigger device is attached or detached, ShadowKVM sends a
# DDC/CI command to the monitor to change its input source.
#
# The DDC/CI command has a command code and a value:
#   code: usually input-select for input source selection
#   value: varies based on the monitor’s supported inputs

# Monitor Identification
#
# You can specify monitors using one or more of these attributes:
#   description: Monitor model name as recognized by Windows
#   adapter: The graphics adapter associated with the monitor
#   serial-number: A unique identifier for the monitor (recommended if you have identical monitors)
#
# If Shadow KVM can detect your monitor's serial number, using it is the most reliable way
# to ensure ShadowKVM targets the correct display.

# Both DDC/CI command code and value can be specified either as a string or as an 8-bit number
#
# Supported command code strings are:
{{Common.AllCodes}}
#
# Supported command value strings are:
{{Common.AllValues}}

# Log level: Controls the level of detail in the log files
# options: information (default) or debug
log-level: information
